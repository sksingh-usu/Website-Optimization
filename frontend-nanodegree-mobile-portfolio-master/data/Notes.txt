Observation in Initial Time Line -- Mobile/Desktop-- 28/30
1. Big Differences between Document content Load(Blue Dashed line),Paint(Green Dashed Line) and Load Event Line(Red Dashed Line)
This depicts that there is a lot of time spend in receiving the data and also to paint the data. This leads to the first hint of expensive resources being downloaded.
2. Multiple Recalculations of the styles on the document node.
3. Multiple Janks because of Analytics.js recalculating styles

Solution:
Image Compression and Resizing
Result- Mobile/Desktop-- 40/53

Style Sheet Optimization
Huge gain
Result- Mobile/Desktop-- 77/89

Resource Optimization
Removed the web fonts
Result- Mobile/Desktop-- 80/89


Jank left and that is due to analytics.js was manipulating DOM and so there were multiple recalculations and hence I deferred it by making it ASYNC
Mobile/Desktop -- 94/95
Loads and scripting function call moved beyond the load line
